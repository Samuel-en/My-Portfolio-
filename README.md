## About Me 

This project was about creating a webpage from scratch, utilizing bootstrap CDN 
links for css and javascript. In the about me page i used a bootstrap card 
layout and i inserted and image and also wrote some details about my current 
job and how i came to be in the fullstack web dev certification course in 
GA Tech. Along with the card i was successfuly able to link my nav tabs so 
i can navigate easily from one page to another. I was also able to successfully 
add a sticky footer. 

## Portfolio

In the portfolio page i brought another card over from bootstrap and inserted 
five image place holders. i also placed the h1 inside the container which 
came with code for the card.

## Contact  

in the contact page i used a card from bootstrap and inserted 
a form also from bootstrap. In all pages the navigation bar is
present and the functionality is good.
