                My name is Samuel Endrias, I am currently studying fullstack web development 
                at Ga Tech. I hope to get my certification in web development and work in the field to master 
                the art of programming. I am currently working as a claims adjuster in The Home Depot 
                program, for a company called Sedgwick. My main role as an adjuster is to investigate property 
                damage claims which are made by customers, vendors, and contractors. I determine liablity based 
                on evidence and make a decision whether to pay on a claim or deny. The job is interesting but there
                isnt alot of room for creativity, its very procedural and redundant. 
                <br>
                <br>
                My appreciation for web dev began when i was 
                exposed to it through a friend, who, at the time was working for AT&T. i saw all the interesting projects 
                he was involved in and the ability he had to create, maintain websites. I had always know 
                myself to be a creative and innovative person and i knew that programming would allow me 
                to express myself in such away. And so under the advicement of my friend and the desire to be challenged 
                and grow i made a decision to enroll into the Ga Tech web development profession certification course.
